# `Run Project` button - Gallery

This gallery lists up to date forks of popular repos from GitHub. It was created to illustrate the use of the `Run Project` button added to each of them.

Click the button to quickly and safely install any of the projects on your local machine.

The `Run Project` button employs `azk`, a lightweight open source orchestration tool that will automatically isolate and configure the application's environment for you.

The addition of the button, references to its use on the README and the `azk` manifest file for each project are the only changes applied to these forks.

Learn more about `azk` [here](https://github.com/azukiapp/azk).
